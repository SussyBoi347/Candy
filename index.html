The Milky Way bar's North American variant is made of nougat topped with caramel and covered with milk chocolate. It was created in 1923 by Frank C. Mars and originally manufactured in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the name and taste derived from a then-popular malted milk drink (milkshake) of the day, not after the astronomical galaxy.[6][7]

On March 10, 1925, the Milky Way trademark was registered in the US, claiming a first-use date of 1922.[8] In 1924, the Milky Way bar was introduced nationally, with sales totalling $800,000 that year. The chocolate for the chocolate coating was supplied by Hershey's.[9]

By 1926, two variants were available: chocolate nougat with milk chocolate coating, and vanilla nougat with a dark chocolate coating, each selling for 5¢. In June 1932, the bar was marketed as a two-piece bar, and four years later, in 1936, the chocolate and vanilla were separated. The vanilla version, with a dark chocolate coating, was called "Forever Yours," marketed until 1979.[10] In 1989, Forever Yours was reintroduced and renamed "Milky Way Dark" and later "Milky Way Midnight".[11]

In 1935, Mars used the marketing slogan "The sweet you can eat between meals,"[9] later using "At work, rest and play, you get three great tastes in a Milky Way." By 2006, Mars used the slogan "Comfort in every bar" in the US and most recently "Life's better the Milky Way."[12]


Milky Way Simply Caramel bar
In 2010, the Milky Way Simply Caramel bar went on sale, a version with caramel covered in milk chocolate and without nougat. In 2011, Mars introduced a small size (marketed as fun size) Simply Caramel bar. A salted caramel version has since been introduced.

In 2012, Milky Way Caramel Apple Minis went on sale as a limited offer for the Halloween season.

In late summer of 2018, Milky Way Fudge, which substitutes the malt nougat with chocolate fudge nougat, was introduced nationwide.[13]

The American Milky Way bar has 240 calories in each 52.2 gram bar; the smaller Milky Way Midnight has 220 calories in each 50 gram bar; and the Milky Way Simply Caramel bar has 250 calories in each 54 gram bar.

The first Peanut Butter Cup, a peanut butter and chocolate confection, was launched in 1928 by the H.B. Reese Candy Company. The official product name was actually "Penny Cups" because, at the time, the confection could be purchased for one cent.[15]

In 1963, The Hershey Company purchased the H.B. Reese Candy Company from H.B. Reese's sons.[16] Since then, the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product portfolio has grown to sell different variations of the product, using alternate chocolate or candy coatings, offering different sizes, and honoring different seasonal holidays and events. As the introduction of these variations took off in popularity, they soon earned a permanent spot in the product portfolio.[17]

The first non-original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product brand variation was launched in 1976, under the product name "Reese's Crunchy". The Reese's Crunchy product brand variation featured a crunchy peanut butter creme, as opposed to the smooth peanut butter creme in the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.[18]

In 1987, the first Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, King Size was launched.[19]

In July 2016, The Hershey Company launched a product variation that merges two of Reese's products: Reese's Pieces and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The new product brand variation is called Reese's Pieces Peanut Butter Cups which consist of the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that has Reese's Pieces candy mixed in to the peanut butter filling.[20]

In September 2020, The Hershey Company announced the introduction of a new product variation on the Reese's Peanut Butter Big Cup that will include pretzel pieces within the peanut butter creme filling, called "Reese’s Big Cups with Pretzels". At the same time, Hershey also announced the limited edition Big Cup launching in March 2021 called "Big Cup with Chips" which will be a Reese's Big Cup with potato chips mixed into the peanut butter creme filling.[

Dairy milk

<p>
The original Dairy Milk bar ("with a glass and a half of fresh milk") was launched in 1905.[13]

Variant bars include Caramel, "Fruit & Nut" (a bar with raisins and almonds), "Whole Nut" (with hazelnuts), "Dairy Milk Silk" and a bar with a Turkish delight centre. Dairy Milk Ritz, a bar with salty Ritz crackers was launched in the United Kingdom in 2014. Alongside this new bar, Dairy Milk with LU biscuits was also launched. The 1970s television advertising campaign for the "Whole Nut" featured a series of commercials with the tag line "Nuts, whole hazelnuts. Ooh! Cadbury's taken them and they cover them in chocolate".[14][15]

A Vegemite flavoured bar, which consists of milk chocolate, caramel, and Vegemite (5%), was launched in Australia in 2015.

In 1986 the glass and a half symbol appeared on the front of the Irish Dairy Milk wrapper.

<h3>
Hersheys
</h3>
<img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/hersheysassets/0_34000_00240_5_701_24000_097_Item_Front?fmt=png-alpha&hei=1500" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>
The Hershey Process milk chocolate in these bars uses fresh milk delivered directly from local farms. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and produced the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States and Canada, but less so internationally, especially in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a company and trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed. This produces butyric acid (a compound found in substances such as Parmesan cheese and vomit) which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This flavor gives the product a "tangy" taste that the US public has come to associate with the taste of chocolate,[25] to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates.[26][unreliable source?] Outside of the US people are not as accustomed to the taste. In Canada this led to Hershey introducing a reformulated Canadian bar in 1983.[27]

Starting in 2006, Hershey has added polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) to their chocolate, except for the traditional plain milk chocolate Hershey's Kisses. In 2015, Hershey announced they would begin removing PGPR from the rest of their chocolate.[28] Artificial vanillin was also removed in 2015.[29] Hershey did remove PGPR from some of their chocolate bars, but in April 2019 started putting it back in Hershey's Milk Chocolate with Almonds full size bar, and plain milk chocolate bars, and never removed it from Symphony milk chocolate and other products. Hershey does not claim to use vanilla in their chocolate, only natural flavor, which may be the same chemical as the artificial one it replaces, except created from a natural source through several processes.

<h3>
Milk duds

In 1928, Hoffman and Company of Chicago tried to manufacture a spherical, chocolate-covered caramel candy. Because they were unsuccessful in achieving the spherical shape, the candies were called "duds". This inspired the candy's name, "Milk Duds". In the same year, Holloway took over Hoffman and Company and the production of Milk Duds.[3]

In 1960 Holloway sold Hoffman and Co. to Beatrice Foods.[2]

In 1986, Leaf purchased the Milk Duds business. In 1992, production of Milk Duds candy was moved to Leaf Candy Company's Robinson, Illinois plant.[2]

In 1996, Leaf's North American confectionery operation was acquired by Hershey Foods Corporation of Hershey, Pennsylvania

<h3>
Snickers
</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+r1gAwsZL._SX425_.jpg" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>
In 1930,[1] Mars introduced Snickers, named after the favorite horse of the Mars family.[5] The Snickers chocolate bar consists of nougat, peanuts, and caramel with a chocolate coating. The bar was marketed under the name "Marathon" in the UK and Ireland until 1990, when Mars decided to align the UK product with the global Snickers name (Mars had marketed and discontinued an unrelated bar named Marathon in the United States during the 1970s which was similar to the UK's Curly Wurly). There are also several other Snickers products such as Snickers mini, dark chocolate, ice cream bars, Snickers with almonds, Snickers with hazelnuts, Snickers with pecans, Snickers peanut butter bars, Snickers protein and Snickers with Extra Caramel, as well as espresso, fiery, and sweet & salty versions.

<p>
The product was first produced in the United Kingdom in 1967,[3] and introduced in the United States in 1979.[3] Twix was called Raider in mainland Europe for many years before its name was changed in 1991 (2000 in Denmark, Finland,[4] Norway, Sweden and Turkey) to match the international brand name.[citation needed]

In 2014, the company introduced Twix bites.

<h3>
Kitkat

<p>
Kit Kat is a chocolate-covered wafer bar confection created by Rowntree's of York, United Kingdom, and is now produced globally by Nestlé (which acquired Rowntree's in 1988),[1] except in the United States, where it is made under license by the H. B. Reese Candy Company, a division of the Hershey Company.

The standard bars consist of two or four pieces composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped from the bar separately. There are many flavours of Kit Kat, including milk, white, and dark chocolate.

The original four-finger version of the bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York factory put a suggestion in the recommendation box for "a chocolate bar that a man could take to work in his pack up".[2] It was launched in September 1935 in the UK as Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp, and the later two-finger version was launched in 1936. It was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, and just Kit Kat after World War II.[3] Since making its first television appearance in a UK commercial in 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been "Have a break... have a Kit Kat".[3][4][5] Since 1986 in the U.S., the jingle used in television advertisements has been "Gimme a break, Gimme a break, Break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar!"

Ferrero rocher
</h3>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91qi6PV+XBL._SL1500_.jpg" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>
Ferrero Rocher (Italian pronunciation: [ferˈrɛːro roʃˈʃe]) is a chocolate and hazelnut product produced by the Italian confectionery company Ferrero. Its creation is attributed to Michele Ferrero, previously the owner of Ferrero SpA, who introduced the sweet in 1979.

Each Ferrero Rocher ball is covered in foil and placed into a paper liner. The confectionery is machine made and much of its production process is designed to be secretive.[1] The candy is sold worldwide and holds a strong cultural presence, in part due to its association with Christmas and its popular 1990s advert[2] that aired in the United Kingdom.

<h3>
Lindt
</h3>
<img src="https://images.heb.com/is/image/HEBGrocery/000289175" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>
The origins of the company date back to 1836, when David Sprüngli-Schwarz and his son Rudolf Sprüngli-Ammann bought a small confectionery shop in the old town of Zürich, producing chocolates under the name David Sprüngli & Son. Before they moved to Paradeplatz in 1845, they established a small factory where they produced their chocolate in solidified form in 1838.

When Rudolf Sprüngli-Ammann retired in 1892, he gave two equal parts of the business to his sons. The younger brother David Robert received two confectionery stores that became known under the name Confiserie Sprüngli. The elder brother Johann Rudolf received the chocolate factory. To raise the necessary finances for his expansion plans, Johann Rudolf then converted his private company into "Chocolat Sprüngli AG" in 1899. In that same year, he acquired the chocolate factory of Rodolphe Lindt in Bern, and the company changed its name to "Aktiengesellschaft Vereinigte Berner und Zürcher Chocoladefabriken Lindt & Sprüngli" (United Bern and Zurich Lindt and Sprungli Chocolate Factory Ltd.).[3]

Expansion
In 1994, Lindt & Sprüngli acquired the Austrian chocolatier Hofbauer Österreich and integrated it, along with its Küfferle brand, into the company. In 1997 and 1998, respectively, the company acquired the Italian chocolatier Caffarel and the American chocolatier Ghirardelli,[4][5] and integrated both of them into the company as wholly owned subsidiaries. Since then, Lindt & Sprüngli has expanded the once-regional Ghirardelli to the international market.

On 17 March 2009, Lindt announced the closure of 50 of its 80 retail boutiques in the United States because of weaker demand in the wake of the late-2000s recession.

<h3>
Nutella

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91PRnyd4ENL._SY606_.jpg" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>
Pietro Ferrero owned a bakery in Alba, an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the initial 300 kilograms (660 lb) batch of Pasta Gianduja, derived from Gianduja. Originally sold as a solid block, Ferrero started to sell a creamy version in 1951 as Supercrema gianduja.[5]

In 1963, Ferrero's son Michele Ferrero revamped Supercrema gianduja with the intention of marketing it throughout Europe. Its composition was modified, and it was renamed "Nutella". The first jar of Nutella left the factory in Alba on April 20, 1964. The product was an instant success and remains widely popular.[6]

In 2012, French senator Yves Daudigny proposed a tax increase on palm oil from €100 to €400 per tonne. At 20 percent, palm oil is one of Nutella's main ingredients, and the tax was dubbed "the Nutella tax" in the media.[7]

On 14 May 2014, Poste italiane issued a 50th anniversary Nutella commemorative stamp.[8][9] The 70 Euro cent stamp was designed by Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato and features a jar of Nutella on a golden background.[8] Ferrero held a Nutella Day on 17 and 18 May to celebrate the anniversary.
